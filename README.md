# Unibrowser Backend Scapers
Data acquisition scripts to assist with populating the Unibrowser database with useful university information

## For Developers
The scripts are developed using **Python version 3.6**. Unit tests are done using `pytest`. The best way to develop this project is to use a virtual python environment and install the necessary dependencies, modifying the `requirements.txt` file as needed to add new dependencies.

### Dependency Installation
To install the necessary dependencies on your system, the following pre-requisites needs to be met:
- `python-dev` and `python3-dev` system packages are installed (used when compiling certain library dependencies)

```text
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python setup.py
```
